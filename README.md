# My Spring Boot learning journey
A repo where i will be collecting projects while working out projects and examples from the "Spring Boot Up & Running" by Mark Heckler and "Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6" Christian Ullenboom books. Perhaps i will look at the other resources at some later point too

## "Spring Boot Up & Running" by Mark Heckler
After working out this book i can say that it is a good start and it does cover the main Spring Boot aspects used in the most simple REST-, MVC-Projects. However, in my opinion, it doesn't provide you with the full picture of what happens in the Spring Framework "guts", apart from explaining major annotations like @SpringBootApplication, @Entity, @Configuration, etc. I guess it was also not the intention of the author to do so.

This beast is on the row, haven't started it yet
